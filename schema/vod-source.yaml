  VariationDescriptor:

      This descriptor class is used for describing VRS Variation value objects.
      This is a subclass of :ref:`ValueObjectDescriptor` and inherits all Value
      Object Descriptor attributes.

          The molecular context of this variant. Must be one of "genomic",
          "transcript", or "protein".
      structural_type:
        $ref_curie: "vrs:CURIE"
        description: >-
          The structural variant type associated with this variant. We RECOMMEND a descendent term of
          `SO:0001537 <http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_release/term/SO:0001537>`_.
      expressions:
        $ref: "#/$defs/Expression"
        description: >-
          Typically HGVS or ISCN nomenclature expressions. Other systems relevant to the description
          of variation MAY be used.
      vcf_record:
        $ref: "#/$defs/VcfRecord"
        description: >-
          A VCF Record of the variant. This SHOULD be a single allele, the VCF genotype (GT) field
          should be represented in the *allelic_state* attribute.
      gene_context:
        description: >-
          A specific gene context that applies to this variant.
        oneOf:
          - $ref_curie: "vrs:CURIE"
          - $ref: "#/$defs/GeneDescriptor"
      vrs_ref_allele_seq:
        $ref_curie: "vrs:Sequence"
        description: >-
          A `VRS Sequence`_ corresponding to a "ref allele", describing the sequence expected at a
          `VRS SequenceLocation`_ reference.
      allelic_state:
        $ref_curie: "vrs:CURIE"
        description: >-
          We RECOMMEND that the *allelic_state* of a variation be described by terms from the
          Genotype Ontology (GENO). These SHOULD descend from concept
          `GENO:0000875 <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_0000875>`.

  VcfRecord:
    description: >-
      This data class is used when it is desirable to pass data as expected from a VCF record.
      The class is only used as an optional attribute within a :ref:`VariationDescriptor`.
      The Genotype field from a VCF should be captured by the `allelic_state` attribute in
      the Variation Descriptor.

          a list in the :ref:`VariationDescriptor` `xrefs` field.

        type: string
        description: >-
